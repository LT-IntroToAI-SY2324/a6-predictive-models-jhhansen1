# Part 2 - Training and Testing Data Writeup

After completing `a6_part2.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What makes this model more effective than the model you created in the previous lesson? It uses training and testing plots instead of just looking at all of the data.


2. What does the R squared coefficient tell you about the model?
The r squared value is how well the data fits the linear regression model

3. Would you say that your model is accurate? What evidence supports your conclusion? Consider the meaning of the predicted and actual values in the context of the chart below from the American Heart Associationâ€™s website on understanding blood pressure. I dont think my data is that accurate because the r_squared value is only .609 which is not a very strong correlation.
