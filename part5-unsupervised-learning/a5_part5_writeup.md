# Part 5 - Unsupervised Learning Writeup

After completing `a6_part5.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. Develop a name for each customer group based on the information from the graph. For example, one group might be called “Frugal” while another might be called “Shopaholic.” Explain your reasoning for each label. the red group would be the shopaholics because they have a low income but a high spending score. The green top right would be snobby because they have a high income and a high spending score. the blue group in the middle would be the average people because they have an average income and an average spending score. The purple group in the bototm left would be frugal because they have a low income and a low spending score. the orange group in the bottom right would be savers because they have a high income but a low spending score.

2. What group would a customer who has a medium income and low spending habits be in?
it depends because they are in the middle of three different clusers so it depends if they lean slightly one way or another what group they would go into. 
3. Choose one cluster of interest to you. How might the marketing team approach this specific customer group? The green group in the top right could probably be easily marketed to buy expensive luxary goods because they have the income to afford these types of products and they spend alot of money.
